# 498-IoT-final-project
Final Project for ECE 498 IoT SP19


This Project attempts to detect free and open spaces to study/lecture hall seats using object detection.

Proposed Plan:

1) Detect chairs using a mobilenet/YOLO?
2) Detect humans using same procedure and detect if there is a human very close to a chair then mark the chair as occupied.
3) Then this can extend to any image we see of a lecture hall etc, and be immune to changes in perspective etc
